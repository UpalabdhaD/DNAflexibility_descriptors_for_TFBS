# Modeling Transcription Factor Binding Specificity with DNA Flexibility Descriptors

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains all the data, code, and results necessary to reproduce the analyses and figures for the study investigating the role of DNA flexibility in describing and predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBS).

## Project Overview

The central hypothesis of this work is that biophysical properties of DNA, such as its flexibility, contain crucial information about transcription factor (TF) binding preferences beyond what is captured by the DNA sequence alone. This project uses machine learning models, specifically L2-regularized Multinomial Logistic Regression (L2MLR), to quantify the contribution of DNA flexibility descriptors.

The main analyses include:
*   Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
*   Building and evaluating predictive models for TF binding using both 1-mer and DNA flexibility features.
*   Analyzing feature importance to understand which DNA positions and flexibility parameters are most critical for binding.
*   Classifying genomic regions based on model predictions.

## How to Reproduce the Analysis

### 1. Prerequisites

You will need R and RStudio installed on your system. The analysis relies on several key R packages, which can be installed by running the following command in an R console:

```R
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse",      # For data manipulation (dplyr) and plotting (ggplot2)
  "rmarkdown",      # To process the .Rmd files
  "knitr",          # To knit the Rmd files
  "ComplexHeatmap", # For creating advanced heatmaps
  "glmnet",         # For L2-regularized logistic regression
  "ggrepel"         # For better plot labels
))
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/UpalabdhaD/DNAflexibility_descriptors_for_TFBS.git
cd DNAflexibility_descriptors_for_TFBS
```

### 3. Run the Analysis

The entire analysis is encapsulated in R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files located in the `SCRIPT/` directory. Each file corresponds to a figure from the paper.

To reproduce a figure:
1.  Open an R Markdown file (e.g., `SCRIPT/Figure_01.Rmd`) in RStudio.
2.  Run the code chunks sequentially, or click the **"Knit"** button in RStudio to execute the entire script and generate the corresponding report and figures.
3.  The output figures will be saved to the `FIGURES/` directory and results to the `RESULTS/` directory.
